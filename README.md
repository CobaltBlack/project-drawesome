# Robotic Drawing Arm
This project was made for the SFU Rembrandt Robotics 2017 Competition. The objective was to create a system that can take a picture,  convert picture to drawing instructions, then output to a physical canvas using a robotic arm.

This was built to run a Raspberry Pi and controls a 3 degrees-of-freedom robotic arm. Please view the Documentation for a complete description of the project implementation.
